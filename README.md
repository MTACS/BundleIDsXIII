BundleIDs

A Cydia application to retrieve the bundle ID of any of app on your device with the push of a button.

This was originally created by Noah Saso (Sassoty) but updated for iOS 11 seeing as it is no longer being updated by noah and is only compiled for 32-bit. Please see below for a list of known issues and future plans for this updated version. If Noah decided to update this himself, I most likely will stop this project.

1) App icons do not always seem to appear
2) Support for iPhone X display (cureently fixable with NoMoreSmallApps by SparkDev)
3) Navbar Title fixes (not showing currently)
